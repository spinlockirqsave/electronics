KEY FUNCTIONS:
The UP output waveform select
The DOWN output waveform select
LEFT output frequency -
RIGHT output frequency +
STOP / RUN the output stop / start

"UP" key waveforms order:
ECG = electrocardiogram wave (in the OFF state, the "left "and "right" keys to set the output frequency. Middle button start, all of the following waveform set)
Rev Sawtooth = reverse sawtooth
SawTooth = sawtooth
Triangle = triangle wave
Square = square wave
